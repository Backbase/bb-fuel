# Contributing to bb-fuel
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under our license and copyright
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same conditions described on [LICENSE](https://github.com/Backbase/bb-fuel/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Backbase/bb-fuel/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Backbase/bb-fuel/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Please, when you hit the [new issue](https://github.com/Backbase/bb-fuel/issues/new) button, select the _Bug report_ template and write all the required information.
